# Menulator
This was for a Web API competition hosted by the technology consulting group Kikoda who is based in Tallahassee, FL. 
The competition required teams to formulate an idea and to make it come to fruition through the use of a web API.
Our team decided on creating an application that took in a menu as an image and translated its contents into a desirable language.
The problem that we had in mind was that tourists go to authentic restaurants in foreign countries but might have trouble understanding the
contents of their menus. 

We decided to incorporate two APIs for this project. The first one was Googles Vision API which extracts the text content from images. 
The second API was the Microsoft Azure Translation API which would then translate the text that was extracted from the Google Vision API.
The end result would be translated text into the language that a user may have set.

The image sample used for the code above is here:
